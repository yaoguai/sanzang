.SH NAME
szu\-t \- translate CJK text into other languages
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B szu\-t
[options] table_file [file ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a program for translating Chinese, Japanese, or Korean (CJK) text into
other languages. The translation method uses rules defined in a translation
table file. These rules are applied at runtime to generate a text translation
listing. If no input files are specified, text is read from the standard input
(stdin). Program output is written to the standard output (stdout).
.PP
This program requires a translation table file, which is a delimited text file
in the following format:
.PP
.B shijie|world
.br
.B nihao|hello
.PP
Each line is a translation rule, and each translation rule consists of two or
more fields delimited by the \*(lq|\*(rq character. The number of fields must
be consistent throughout the entire table. The first field specifies a term in
the source language, and subsequent fields define equivalent terms in the
target language(s).
.PP
Using the example table depicted above, if we attempt to translate the text
\*(lqnihao, shijie\*(rq, then the output of the program is:
.PP
.B 1.1| nihao, shijie
.br
.B 1.2| \ hello , \ world
.PP
Translation tables may contain any number of translation rules, and translation
rules may contain Unicode characters. If you are editing a translation table
through a text editor, the table should be saved using the UTF-8 encoding. All
input and output by this translation program is handled as UTF-8, which ensures
safe string translation between languages.
.PP
Within a translation table, the translation rules should be reverse-sorted by
the length of the source term (i.e. longest terms first, shortest terms last).
General table editing and formatting can be handled by the \fBszu-ed\fR(1)
editor, which automatically handles the correct table formatting.
.PP
For more details on translation table formatting and development, please refer
to the Sanzang Utils tutorial.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
print usage information and then exit
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
include information useful for debugging
.SH EXIT STATUS
The exit status is 0 on normal termination, and 1 on error.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Errors will print a message to the standard error stream (stderr). To enable
stack traces for debugging, enable the \*(lqverbose\*(rq option.
.SH EXAMPLES
.B $ szu\-t mytable infile > outfile
.PP
Translate text from \fIinfile\fR to \fIoutfile\fR, using the rules in
\fImytable\fR.
.PP
.B $ cat mytext | szu\-r | szu\-t mytable | less
.PP
Use the program as a filter with piped input and output.
