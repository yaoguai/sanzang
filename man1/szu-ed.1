.SH NAME
szu\-ed \- edit a translation table
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B szu\-ed
[\fIoptions\fR] \fItable_file\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a program for editing Sanzang translation table rules. The editor can
accept a small number of commands that allow one to add, modify, or remove
translation table rules, as well as print the contents, or save the table back
as a file.
.PP
Editor operations are read from the standard input (stdin), while editor output
is written to the standard output (stdout). Any errors are output to standard
error (stderr).
.PP
Input to the editor is line-based and consists of commands and data. Lines
beginning with the \*(lq\\\*(rq character are interpreted as commands, while
those not beginning with this character are interpreted as data.
.PP
Commands for changing the editor mode are:
.PP
\fB\\get\fR \- Get a table rule (req. source term)
.br
\fB\\set\fR \- Set a table rule (req. table rule)
.br
\fB\\rm\fR \- Remove a table rule (req. source term)
.PP
Commands for immediate editor operations are:
.PP
\fB\\p\fR \- Print the current table
.br
\fB\\q\fR \- Quit without saving
.br
\fB\\w\fR \- Write back to the file
.br
\fB\\wq\fR \- Write back to the file and quit
.PP
When data is entered, the action taken is determined by the editor mode. If the
mode requires a table rule, then you will need to enter a table rule in the
proper format, such as (for two columns):
.PP
.B nihao|hello
.PP
This is the same format as the data of the translation table itself. On the
other hand, if the current mode requires a source term, then only the first
column of the record should be supplied, like so:
.PP
.B nihao
.PP
The general principle is that a mode that inserts or modifies data naturally
requires the full rule to be specified, while a mode that just needs to fetch
or remove an existing rule only requires the source term to do the lookup.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
print usage information and then exit
.SH EXIT STATUS
The exit status is 0 on normal termination, and 1 on error.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Errors will print a message to the standard error stream. A stack trace will be
printed if the editor encounters a runtime error.
.SH EXAMPLES
Example editor invocation:
.PP
.B $ szu\-ed mytable < script
.PP
Example editor input:
.PP
.B
\\set
.br
.B
nihao|hello
.br
.B
zaijian|goodbye
.br
.B
\\rm
.br
.B
