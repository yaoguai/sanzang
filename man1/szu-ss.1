.SH NAME
szu\-ss \- table-based string substitution
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B szu\-ss
[options] table_file
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a program for making fixed string substitutions using a two-column
translation table file. After reading the input text, each source term is
translated into its translated into its equivalent translation term. Three
types of substitutions are made for each term: with normal capitalization,
converted to lowercase, and converted to uppercase. Substitutions will also be
made if the source term only matches part of the word, so this tool should be
used with caution. This program reads text from the standard input (stdin) and
writes text to the standard output (stdout).
.PP
For more details on translation table formatting and development, please refer
to the tutorial, as well as the manual page for szu\-t.
.SH OPTIONS

\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR

.SH EXIT STATUS
The exit status is 0 on normal termination, and 1 on error.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS

stack traces for debugging, enable the \*(lqverbose\*(rq option.
.SH EXAMPLES
.B $ szu\-ss mytable < infile > outfile
