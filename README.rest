Sanzang Utils
=============

The Sanzang Utilities are a small collection of programs for translating from
Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (the CJK languages). These tools can be used for
generating rough but useful translations that closely follow the source text.
These programs are available under the MIT License.

The Sanzang translation tools use a delimited text file for storing translation
rules, and a command-based editor is also included that can do both interactive
editing and scripted table editing. The utilities included in this package are:

* szu-ed(1) - Command-based translation table (ed)itor
* szu-r(1) - Preprocessor for (r)eformatting CJK text
* szu-t(1) - The main (t)ranslation program
* szu-ss(1) - Make (s)tring (s)ubstitutions

These programs all come with the appropriate Unix manual pages. Documentation
aims to be complete and accurate. Missing or inaccurate information may be
filed as a bug.

Installation
------------

To run these programs, Python 3.x is required. Installation on a Unix-like
platform is advised, but Windows is possible too. If you must use Windows, then
Cygwin is the best environment for these programs.

To install these programs the "Python way," you can use setup.py::

    # python3 setup.py install

Otherwise, you could do it the "Unix way" by using the makefile::

    # make install

If you install with the Makefile, you can also uninstall with the makefile::

    # make uninstall

The choice of which installation method to use is just a personal preference.

Learning more
-------------

After installing Sanzang Utils, you may read the tutorial which is included in
this package. The tutorial gives an introduction to each aspect of the system,
including how to develop and apply your own translation tables.
